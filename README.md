# OpenGL WinterGames 2005
A fun little game based on a programming lab course, a friend of mine and I did in our 2nd (?) year at university! Do NOT expect any updates! ðŸ˜†

This is the result of the final assignment of that course (at the chair [CAMP-AR at TUM](https://www.in.tum.de/campar) in Munich with Prof. Navab). The initial task was to load a dataset (GPS-based height information on a regular grid of the Matterhorn mountain), render it using OpenGL, and "do something fun with it". So we made a game, where you ski down the mountain. It escalated a bit, though, as we added different play modes, AI opponents and lokal networking support! ðŸ¤£
